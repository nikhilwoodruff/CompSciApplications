Markdown

1. Interest of content: Outstanding 

2. Consistency and quality of visual presentation: Excellent  
    -> links could be added to some of the pictures - example: the "history of hacking" picture was small so the text was unreadable; a link to the full resolution picture would be helpful
    -> captioning of image is inconsistent on each page: some used "fig"; some gave descriptions and some did not have any captions 

3. Quality of written presentation: Examplary
    -> "Automatic thermostats can regulate temperature and save money/energy/" in iot.html has an extra hanging "/"

4. Validity of HTML: Perfect

5. Evidence of collaboration including: 
    - Author info not written by author: Perfect
        -> author's info could be more detailed 
    - Balanced contributions from members: Examplary
    - Not completed at the last minute: Excellent
