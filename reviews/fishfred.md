# Review

There were no HTML or Grammar issues that I could find, but the HTML could have been formatted nicer to make it easier to read.

## Interest of Content

All the content is interesting and related to each other and to computer science.

> Exemplary

## Consistency and quality of visual presentation

All the pages follow the same style, making the text easy to read and the site easy to navigate.

There is a navigation bar which automatically scales depending on the width of the page, and is consistent on all pages.

Images are included on most pages and are embedded in the web page well.

There is also a consistent footer which displays relevent author information, with clear icon links to the author's github and linkedin profiles.

> Outstanding

## Quality of written presentation

All the text on the pages is grammatically correct, and is written in a clear and engaging style.

> Outstanding

## Validity of HTML

All valid

> Perfect

## Evidence of collaboration

All contributors have contributed equally, however there is a large amount of commits with unclear names which could be cleared up. Each piece of Author information is written by another contributor.

The last commit was at the last minute, which fixed minor issues. This was to fix something someone had only just noticed. The vast majority of work had been done more than 2 days ago.

> Good
