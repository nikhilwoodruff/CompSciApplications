### Interest of content 

* The content is interesting, there is a lot of it, however, it's very well laid out with the use of the bootstrap grid
* The content follows well and is relevant to each of the titles. 

> Excellent

### Visual presentation

* The visual presentation of the site is very clean and consistent - each page has a common theme and the navigation bar remains on each page of the site

> Outstanding

### Written presentation

* Again, very good. No issues here.

> Outstanding

### Validity of HTML

* The HTML is well written and has no issues. Good use of tags.
* The use of a navbar element instead of footer is an interesting choice, however it may be required to get the design that they were looking for. :thumbsup:

> Exemplary

### Evidence of collaboration

* Good use of commits to structure code. Pull requests have been used for collaboration.
* Everyone wrote their own page and there is evidence in the PRs that the work was well balanced
* All the content was completed in time, before the practical.

> Outstanding
