          <h2>What is the Internet of Things?</h2>
          <p>The phrase 'Internet of Things', or IoT, is used to describe objects or devices that can communicate. This includes smartphones and computers but has more recently shown to include wearable technology, coffee machines, doorbells and even smart salt shakers. <br>By connecting these devices, data can be used to learn about a process or carry out benefcial tasks. For example, your wearable sleep tracker could detect that you have woken up and instruct your coffee machine to have a brew ready for you.<br>Other data may be collected in order to benefit consumers, such as, fitness trackers measuring, and providing information on, your physical activity.</p>
