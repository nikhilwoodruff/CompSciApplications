      <h1>A Bit About the other 'Hats'</h1>
      <p>
	<b style="color:#010304;"> Black Hat: </b>The stereotypical 'hacking' - the kind you hear about on news 	
	<br>Hackers commonly use their computer skills to harm or damage computer systems, attempt to find computer security vulnerabilities and tend to exploit them for their own personal gain or other malicious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>	
	<b style="color:grey;"> Grey Hat: </b>Cause neither hacking is just black or white..
	<br>These type of hackers generally have mixed skills and motives of both Black and White hackers. Grey Hat Hacking is mainly not aimed at anything but personal enjoyment. 
      </p>
      <p>
	<b style="color:blue;"> Blue Hat: </b>Just pure revenge
	<br>Blue Hat hackers often take existing code for malware and viruses they find online, then modify it to meet their needs. They will use this code to target the business or individual they feel has wronged them and inflict their revenge.
      </p>
      <p>
	<b style="color:red;"> Red Hat: </b>The caped crusaders of the cyber world
	<br>Bringing justice and putting a stop to Black Hat hackers is what they do. They take the hacker's own arsenal and turn it back against them. Basically a less popularly known White Hat hacker.
      </p>
      <p>
	The last and final<b style="color:green;"> Green Hat: </b>Taking baby steps into the world of hacking
	<br>These are people who are just new to the world of scripting, coding and hacking in general. It's all about learning to be full blow hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
	Now about the <b>White Hat</b>!!....

      <h1>What is it?</h1>
      <p>
	White Hat Hackers, on the other hand, perform <i>ethical hacking</i>. The goal of ethical hacking is to find defects/loopholes in a computer system and determine how to break into the system in order to prevent others from attacking it. If a Black Hat Hacker is able to break into a system, then a White Hat hacker, ideally, is capable of more.
	<br>Although the methods used are similar to those of malicious hackers, white hat hackers have permission to employ these methods against the organization that has hired them.

      <h2>Going Back in Time</h2>
      <p>
	Coming to the usage of the term 'Hats', it comes from Western films, where heroic and antagonistic cowboys might traditionally wear a white and a black hat respectively.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
	<div class="col">
	  <p>
	    One of the first instances of an ethical hack being used was a 'security evaluation' conducted by the US Air Force, in which the Multics (more information can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics">here</a>) operating system was tested for potential use as a 'secret' system. The evaluation determined that while Multics was significantly better than other conventional systems, it also had vulnerabilities in hardware security, software security and procedural security that could be uncovered with a relatively low level of effort.

	<div class="col">
	  <p>
	    By early 80s, white hat activities started being described as a 'mischievous but positivey hacking tradition'. The idea of bringing this tactic of hacking into the cyber world originated from Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema. They aimed at raising the overall security of the Internet. They showed how information could be gathered and exploited, and how such an attack could be prevented and soon, developed an easy-to-use application called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Administrator_Tool_for_Analyzing_Networks">SATAN</a> (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks)

      <h3>Where We Are Now</h3>
      <p>
	Ethical hacking can be used in many ways from giving detailed analysis about the potential risks in IT systems to giving prioritized lists of recommended steps to overcome and eliminate several threats that could be present in systems and strengthen its security.
      </p>
      <p>
	Today, individuals and organisations increasingly continue to use the Internet. Although highly beneficial, it comes along with a variety of concerns regarding the security of the users. For this exact reason, white hat hackers are incredible valuable to today's digitally driven world. Even though a good number of present white hat hackers acquired their skills as previous black hat hackers, they all work towards one common goal, and interestingly have one trait in common: creativity; which quite naturally aids them in their day-to-day work of breaking into several systems.   
      </p>
      <p>
	To face reality, it is almost impossible to design an inpenetrable system because technology itself has built-in security flaws. Although, there still is a lot of work that has to be done, this makes ethical hackers extremely helpful in keeping the Internet safe and information-private.
