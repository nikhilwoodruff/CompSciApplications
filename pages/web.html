                    <p>Imagine a world in which the World Wide Web didn't exist. Google, Facebook, Amazon and all of those services we take for granted today are just glimmers in some programmer's eye. That was the reality just 25 years ago. Not since the Industrial Revolution has there been such a transformation in the lifestyles of people all over the globe. The Web, and all the advacements it has brought, makes our lives almost unrecognisable to people living just a few decades ago.</p>
                    <p>In today's world, information is readily available on a scale never seen before in human history. With a device that sits in the palm of our hand, we have quicker access to information than a scholar standing in the middle of the Library of Alexandria. With these same devices (and the advancements of the Web), it's possible to speak, face-to-face, with people all over the globe in an instant. Decades ago, this would have been expensive - out of reach for most people. Centuries ago, it was a feat that some of the greatest empires of Europe struggled with. Now anyone with an internet connection and a phone can communicate across the oceans as if they didn't exist.</p>

            <h2>The Revolution of our Times</h2>
            <p>Many advancements have been made in recent years: social media, e-commerce, VOIP, video streaming. Every single one of these innovations, that have changed the way we interact with the world and with each other in their own right, rely on the work done by Berners-Lee at CERN. Whilst the interactivity of the modern web was but a glimmer in his eye back in the 90s, the foundations set the stage for what was to come. Even in its nascent stages, the web had a transformative impact, particularly for businesses and academics. </p>
            <div class = "row">
                <div class = "col">
                    <p>Even now, the scope of the web is ever growing. Countries like China and India are increasingly coming online, particularly in the middle-class urban communities. As millions of people experience the web for the first time, they become as equally connected to the rest of the world as they are to their closest neighbour. Imagine getting online to find almost any product imagineable just a few mouse clicks away, distant friends and family available more readily than ever before, and a wealth of information just a search away. Your world would be irreversibly changed. That is the change the web has brought about in the past 26 years.</p>

                <div class = "col">
                    <p>A group I'd also like to talk about is the elderly. Whilst they are typically late adopters of new technologies, the web has begun to permeate their lives, in many cases for the better. Thanks to the web, grandparents can follow the lives of their family with ease through the lens of social media. Speaking anecdotally, this is a huge help for grandparents who struggle to get out of the house and therefore struggle to see relatives. In some cases, it also allows them to reconnect with old colleagues that they may never have spoken to again otherwise. Video calling and VOIP are yet more technologies reliant on the web that help connect grandparents to their distant families. No longer must the elderly become isolated in their twilight years, thanks to the advancements of the web.</p>

            <h2>A Surprisingly Open World</h2>
            <p>In contrast to a lot of the technological and software developments that took off in the 90s (e.g. Windows), the World Wide Web remained entirely open. Sir Tim Berners-Lee never patented the World Wide Web or any of the technologies behind it, ensuring that any developer woulds be able to use his work. This helped cement the Web's dominance over competitors like Gopher with people and organisations setting up their own servers. The web was built from the very start on the idea of the free exchange of information - an idea it has managed to stay mostly true to.</p>
            <p>Of course, the web is not a communist utopia with everything free for all. Business naturally drives many of the large websites currently active. However, where previous networks on the budding Internet were exclusively for academics or the military, the Web was open to all.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "container">
            <h2>Sharing is Caring</h2>
            <p>The Web's revolutionary tide really started to take hold in the early 2000s, when "Web 2.0" entered the scene. Despite the name, Web 2.0 was not a new version of the Web, or even a discrete step (it was far more gradual). Instead, the term refers to the growing interactivity of the web that emerged during the turn of the millenium. This finally achieved Berners-Lee's original goal of a user-driven Web, with more and more content being authored by the users of websites.</p>
            <p>As a result of Web 2.0, the various e-commerce sites such as eBay and Amazon become viable and exploded, along with early social media sites such as MySpace and Friendster. The now-ubiquitous Facebook would emerge a couple of years later. By focusing around the user, these websites paved the way for our modern relationship with the web, where many of us share virtually aspect of our lives with a faceless crowd of followers and Facebook friends. However, these same advancements enable governments to spy on their citizens and companies to sell our data for profit - such is the double-edged sword of technological advancement. For better or for worse, the Web has changed the world.</p>
